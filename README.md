# Instructions on how to use Do Nows

To use these do nows download the file (click on the file you want, then click the down arrow on the right to download), then open it in the browser. **Note: I have organized the files into directories - you can find the most files at this point in the sat-do-nows directory.** We also now have 'infinite' quizzes and worksheets!

You can do this by opening your browser to a blank tab and using the key combination:

- ctrl-o

After opening the file you can regenerate problems with:

- ctrl-r (or by refreshing the page)

To print the files use:

- ctrl-p

## For the Infinite Quizzes

These files start with quiz. Each time you refresh a new quiz version will generate in the browser (only one version is generated at a time). You can then print that version and then regenerate a new version and print that and so on, for whatever amount of quizzes you need. **Note:** Currently infinite quizzes do not contain answer keys.

Enjoy!
